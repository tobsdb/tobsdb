TODO: 

o Work on the docs
o Transactions 
  o Idea: could do map of [transation_id] -> [db_data] and the client has to include the transaction id to execute an operation on the transaction

  o Requirements: 
    o Faster encoding and decoding than JSON
    o Less human readable
o Work on Golang client
x Work on Rust client
o Work on tdb-cli: interactive CLI tool for making tdb queries
o Introduce secondary key which is user tracked
o Relation Features:
  o Joint find/delete/update
