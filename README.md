# TOBS DB - a database by Tobs

## DISCLAIMER

I know absolutely nothing about database design or anything like that.
This is just a fun little project I decided to start because I was a little bored and ended up committing to.

If you see anything that doesn't make sense, feel free to slighlty roast me and/or hmu about how it should be done.

## Overview

In general this project has been fun and I've learned so much about golang and database design - which is the actual objective here, LEARNING.

If this turns out to be a super cool project, used by millions, let it be known that I always believed in myself and remember... "NEVER BACK DOWN, NEVER WHAT?"
