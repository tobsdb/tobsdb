# Introduction

Welcome to the TobsDB documentation!

## What is TobsDB?

TobsDB is a database engine and management system built from scratch in Golang.

## Why TobsDB?

You may be wondering what advantages TobsDB has over other database options...

...Well I'm wondering about that too. If you find out let me know ;).

One thing I like about TobsDB is the built-in schema support. No connections
without schemas(or existing schemas) means you can be sure your data has the right shape.

I like to think TobsDB is super speedy. But I guess no other way to find out than
to test in prod
